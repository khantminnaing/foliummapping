# Creating Mapping Visuals with Folium Library on Python

The Folium library was created in 2014 by Wladimir Schmidt, a cartographer and software developer. Schmidt was inspired by the Leaflet JavaScript library, which is a popular library for creating interactive maps. He wanted to create a Python library that would make it easy to use Leaflet to create interactive maps from Python code.

Folium quickly became a popular library among Python developers, and it is now one of the most popular Python libraries for creating mapping visualizations. Folium is used by a wide range of users, including data scientists, journalists, and web developers.

Folium is a wrapper around the Leaflet JavaScript library. This means that Folium provides a Python interface to all of the features of Leaflet. Folium also provides a number of additional features, such as the ability to easily add GeoJSON and TopoJSON overlays to maps.

Folium is a powerful library for creating interactive mapping visualizations in Python. It is easy to use and it provides a wide range of features. Folium is a great choice for anyone who needs to create interactive maps from Python code.

This repository contains examples and tutorials on how to use the Folium library to create interactive mapping visuals in Python. Folium is a Python library that builds on the Leaflet JavaScript library to make it easy to create and share interactive maps.

Folium supports a wide range of mapping visualizations, including
<ul>
  <li>Choropleth maps</li>
  <li>Heatmaps</li>
  <li>Marker clusters</li>
  <li>GeoJSON overlays</li>
  <li>Custom tilesets</li>
</ul>

This repository provides examples of how to use Folium to create all of these types of mapping visualizations.
